Fairn shuffled groggily down the stairs.  He hadn’t bothered to reset his computer last night, instead opting to go straight to bed.  There was just too much weird stuff happening to him.  If he could, he’d go over to Zalm’s house after breakfast and talk to them about it.  He entered the kitchen and the smell of coffee and sausage filled his nostrils.  His mother stood at the stove, coercing breakfast to life with a spatula amidst a cacophony of delicious spattering.  When she noticed him, she set down the spatula and walked towards the refrigerator.
